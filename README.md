Synopsis of the project:


Our travel agency is a web based project where a user may search for the best travel packages around the world.
It provides best traveling services to the customers and travel agents.
We have created a login for each user.
To promote responsible and interesting tourism so that people can enjoy their holidays at their favorite places.
We have selected the best packages from a number of sites to provide our clients with the most thrilling and affordable experiences.
Our future improvements include collecting details about all packages through the database and purchasing tours directly from our site.



MERN Stack:


We will be using the MERN stack which consists of the following functionalities:

MongoDB: A document-based open source database.

Express: A web application framework for Node.js.

React: A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces.

Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).


WHAT WE USED :


The Backend: creating a package.json file, and installing dependencies like an Express backend server and others. We have used User Authentication and Authorization for login. Bcrypt is used for password hashing. JSON Web Token is an Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.

Data Base Schema: User login and registration will be created using Mongoose.

Server API: adding endpoint routes so the server can perform CRUD (creating, reading, updating and deleting) operations and then testing it using a tool called Postman. Postman makes API development easy. 

Frontend: using ReactJS to create the Frontend.
